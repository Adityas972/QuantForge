# Project-AlphaForge
My Quant Project
AlphaForge is a Python-based trading project featuring my unique, proprietary trading strategy.
It allows you to simulate trades, analyze performance, and test ideas on historical stock data — completely risk-free and offline. This project was designed to quantitatively evaluate trading strategies, providing insight into how they perform across multiple stocks and market conditions.
